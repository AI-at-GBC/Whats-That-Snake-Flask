# SnakeBtyes Web App

A web server for an app concerning detecting types of snakes from images to mitigate harm from venomous snake bites.

Built using Flask, the model that we deployed uses a Faster R-CNN we [previously built](https://github.com/AI-at-GBC/Python_for_Pythons-Snake_Detection) in order to detect snake varieties in images.

## Setup Instructions

- Copy the saved_model folder generated from the [Faster R-CNN Model](https://github.com/AI-at-GBC/Python_for_Pythons-Snake_Detection/tree/main/Faster_R_CNN) to the root directory
- Install the requirements in requirements.txt to your virtual environment
- `flask run`
